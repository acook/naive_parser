Naive Parser
======

This is just an experiment. It only has two real goals:

1. Parse out a file into basic token objects.
2. Sequentially perform an action based upon the tokens in memory.

It's not going to be fast. It's not going to be efficient.
It should, however, be easy to read and understand.

Other Cool Things
------

- I'm using Bundler for dependency management.
- Rspec is being used for a BDD-ish style of testing.
- Pry is being used for exploration and debugging.
- Open4 is being used along with Rspec to test the executable.
- Autotest is now included for continuous testing.
